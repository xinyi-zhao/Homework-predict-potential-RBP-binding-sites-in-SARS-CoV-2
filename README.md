# Homework-predict-potential-RBP-binding-sites-in-SARS-CoV-2

This is the homework from computational biology. We are aimed to predict the RBP sites for SARS-CoV-2.

And when I do my homework,instead of using convolutional network, I also tried transfer learning and apply word2doc method to represent the sequence.
